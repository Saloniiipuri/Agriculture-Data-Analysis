This project involves analyzing a dataset containing product sales data, including units shipped, units sold, and price per kg. The goal of this project is to 
understand sales patterns, identify unsold inventory, and provide insights for decision-making.

## Key Features
- Cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **ydata-profiling**.
- Generation of an interactive **profiling report** for quick insights.
- Identification of outliers and patterns in sales data.

## Profiling Report
The interactive data profiling report can be accessed [here] https://saloniiipuri.github.io/Agriculture-Data-Analysis/profiling_report.html 
It provides:
- Summary statistics of numeric columns.
- Distribution plots for each variable.
- Correlations and interactions between variables.
